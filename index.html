<h3>ALONE IN THE WOODS</h3>
<p>Alone in the woods I felt <br>
    The bitter hostility of the sky and the trees<br>
    Nature has taught her creatures to hate<br>
    Man that fusses and fumes<br>
    Unquiet man<br>
    As the sap rises in the trees<br>
    As the sap paints the trees a violent green<br>
    So rises the wrath of Nature's creatures<br>
    At man<br>
    So paints the face of Nature a violent green.<br>
    Nature is sick at man<br>
    Sick at his fuss and fume<br>
    Sick at his agonies<br>
    Sick at his gaudy mind<br>
    That drives his body<br>
    Ever more quickly<br>
    More and more<br>
    In the wrong direction.
